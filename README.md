Haiku Background Image Maker
============================

**Create your custom background image for your Haiku® desktop**
with the [Haiku Background Image Maker](https://emsspree.github.io/haiku-bg-img/).

The [Haiku® operating system](https://www.haiku-os.org/) by default has a blue desktop background color with the Haiku® logo on it.

Since you can set up multiple [virtual desktops (“Workspaces”)](https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/workspaces.html), you might want to set different colors for each desktop, but you don't want to do without the typical Haiku® logo. This will help you.
